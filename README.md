# Introduction

*[Chunjun 1.12 New Features](docs/changeLog.md)*

Chunjun is a data synchronization tool based on Flink. Chunjun can collect static data, such as MySQL, HDFS, etc, as well as real-time changing data, such as MySQL binlog, Kafka, etc. **At the same time, Chunjun is also a computing framework that supports all the syntax and features of native FlinkSql** , <big>**And provide a large number of [cases](Chunjun-examples)**</big>. Chunjun currently includes the following features:

- Most plugins support concurrent reading and writing of data, which can greatly improve the speed of reading and writing;

- Some plug-ins support the function of failure recovery, which can restore tasks from the failed location and save running time; [Failure Recovery](docs/restore.md)

- The source plugin for relational databases supports interval polling. It can continuously collect changing data; [Interval Polling](docs/offline/reader/mysqlreader.md)

- Some databases support opening Kerberos security authentication;  [Kerberos](docs/kerberos.md)

- Limit the reading speed of source plugins and reduce the impact on business databases;

- Save the dirty data when writing data;

- Limit the maximum number of dirty data;

- Multiple running modes: Local,Standalone,Yarn Session,Yarn Per;

- **Synchronization tasks support transformer operations that execute flinksql syntax;**

- **sql task support is [shared](docs/conectorShare.md) with flinkSql's own connectors;**

The following databases are currently supported:
